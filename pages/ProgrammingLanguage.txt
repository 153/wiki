ProgrammingLanguage

Something used to express processes/functions in a way that's friendly to a human and computer. There's a lot more involved but that's the jist of it. Fun fact: ThisWiki was written in a programming language! 

Common programming languages include C, C++, Java, Javascript, Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, SQL, and  Lisp. Train your skills in all of them  to become the programming master and retire at 28.
