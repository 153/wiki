Siddhartha Gautama was a prince-turned-tramp philosopher hailing from Nepal, and lived from circa 563 BCE -- 483 BCE. His teachings set down the foundations for Buddhism.

There are some [Buddhist texts](/buddhism/) hosted here, and the canon can be read and searched [here](//accesstoinsight.org/).

**Core views, summarized**

*Four truths:*
1. There is dukkha (stress, suffering, dissatisfaction). Birth, aging, and death are dukkha. Sorrow, lamentation, death, and despair are dukkha. Separation from what's beloved and association with what's unbeloved is dukkha. Not getting what one wants is dukkha.
2. The source of dukkha is tanha, craving. Longing, desiring, lusting, and coveting lead to pain. The source of dukkha is ignorance. 
3. There is an end to dukkha: nibbana, the release and relinquishment from tanha. Nibbana comes from one's efforts, in this very life. 
4. Nibbana can be attained through the Buddhist eightfold path of practice. It does not come through faith or ritual. 

*Eight part path:*
1. Right view
