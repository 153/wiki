AddOns

This article is for listing recommended browser add-ons. 
I will list all the add-ons that I personally use. If you have anything to *add on* to this, then start writing from the bottom of the page.

All of these add-ons are available for Firefox and Firefox forks. I highly recommend that you use an FF fork over Firefox, but I'll save this for another article.

Privacy
---
- uBlock Origin - Ad Blocker replacement. Make sure you download Origin, as the original uBlock is not as good.
- HTTPS Everywhere - Speaks for itself
- Self-destructing Cookies -- Speaks for itself
- NoScript -- Disable Javascript, Java, and other plugins
- Request Policy -- NoScript on steroids
- Random Agent Spoofer -- Allows you to 'pretend' that you're using another webbrowser or OS.
- Smart Referer -- Enables smart referers everywhere (send referer only on same domain)

Some of these add-ons could be seen as over-kill, but when it comes to securing your privacy, redundancy is often essential.

Tweaking/Appearance
---
- Greasemonkey
 - Mouseover Pop-up Image Viewer -- Hover over an image and it'll pop up in the center of your browser window.
 - Webcomic Reader -- Controls for reading webcomics (works for e-hentai!)
- Stylish -- Change the the appearance of any website or application.
 - [Download styles here](https://userstyles.org/categories/)
- Firebug 
 -  A tool for web development. Great in MozillaSeamonkey, which lacks an "Inspect element" function. 

Other
---
- Places to CSV [1]- Allows you to export your history and bookmarks to .csv files.
- Omnibar -- Integrates search bar into the location bar (useful for FF forks).
- Image Search Options [(DL)](https://saucenao.com/tools/) -- Reverse image search in the context menu.
- Dictionary Search [(DL)](http://dictionarysearch.mozdev.org/) -- Dictionary search in the context menu.
- Cookie Manager Plus -- Allows you to manage/delete/block the cookies in your browser.
- Down Them All! -- Download all images on a page. You'll use this the most in image dumping threads.
- IDM CC [2] -- A supporting add-on to the best download manager available.
- Rikaichan -- Japanese dictionary extension

Notes
---
- [1] - I use Places to CSV every few months to export my history to Excel before I delete it from my webbrowser. This allows me to keep my history while freeing up RAM at the same time.
- [2] - Requires you to 'buy' Internet Download Manager first. I use this mostly to download YouTube videos.
