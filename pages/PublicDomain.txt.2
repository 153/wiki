PublicDomain

Public domain software (copyfree) is like open source or free software (copyleft), but even more open and more free. People like Richard M. Stallman say that the culture built around "open source" software should be built around "free" software, and free software comes from having strategic limited restrictions in licensing regarding general permissiveness with analysis, usage, redistribution, and modification clauses. But, to say that more freedom comes from legal constraints is stupid, and Stallman should know that! The most free that information can be is when it's in the public domain, as there, it lacks limitations. 

Some software licenses that put software into the public domain include the CC0, Do Whatever The Fuck You Want With It license, and several others. More general information [available here](http://copyfree.org/standard/licenses).

My rational for the public domain -- people are going to copy what they want, how they want; you may as well let them.
