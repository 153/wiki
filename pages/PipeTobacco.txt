Pipe smoking is a very soothing form of smoking. More to come later.. 

### Kinds of Tobacco
* Virginia  
Mild and sweet, not a lot to write home about. 
* Burley  
Classic tobacco flavor. Tastes a bit nutty, or can taste a bit like chocolate. 
* Cavendish  
A very sweet treated form of Virginias that can have licorice notes. Unfortunately, it tends to burn a bit wet, which can leave pipes goopy or require multiple relights. On the upside, the smoke smells great and tastes very mild. 
* Latakia  
Spicy and strong. Some love it, some hate it... if you're mixing your own blend, go easy on this stuff.
* Perique  
Latakia on steroids. A very strong and full-bodied tobacco. 

### Kinds of Pipes
* Corncob

The quintessentially American pipe. These go for around $5 usually, and reliably give cool and flavorful smokes. However, smoking them makes you look like a hillbilly. Lore has it that farmers in the Deep South smoked corncobs to indicate that they were also smokers of weed.

* Briar

The classic wooden pipe. Briar wood is harvested from tree roots. This kind of wood is absorbent and smokes coolly. They look nicer than corncobs, but can run anywhere from $50 to over $1000. 

* Meerschaum

A porous material, notable for being absorbent and easily carved. They tend to be quite pricey, the value determined by the skill of the carver. Over time, they take on an amber color from the tars. Prices tend to start around $100 and go up.
