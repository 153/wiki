**Marcus Aurelius** was a man who lived from 121 CE -- 180 CE, in ancient Rome. He was the last of the Five Great Emperors, and is well-known for being the realization of Plato's PhilosopherKing, being a philosopher whose treatise, *Meditations*, is often looked to as the best work for understanding the Stoic school of philosophy which began as a sissified version of the school of Cynicism which DiogenesOfSinope began. His views bear some resemblance to those of GautamaBuddha and JesusChrist.

## Quotes
* &gt;When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil.

* &gt;Yet living and dying, honour and dishonour, pain and pleasure, riches and poverty, and so forth are equally the lot of good men and bad. Things like these neither elevate nor degrade; and therefore they are no more good than they are evil. 

* &gt;Remember that man lives only in the present, in this fleeting instant; all the rest of his life is either past and gone, or not yet revealed. Short, therefore, is man's life, and narrow is the corner of the earth wherein he dwells. 

* &gt;The universe is flux, life is opinion.

* &gt;Soon you will have forgotten the world, and soon the world will have forgotten you.

* &gt;It is not right to vex ourselves at things, For they care not about it.
