&gt; I have a picture of Shii on my computer. I always thought he was cute... until I heard his voice &gt;_&gt;

There's a gold thread about him on SomethingAwful, some scandal about his alleged pedophilia, that drove him into a fury so great that it caused him to leave the world of traditional boards in lieu of AnonyMous ImageBoard's and TextBoard's (he even made his own, ShiiChan, which powered WorldFourCh).  Formerly had a homepage at http://shii.org/. RIP a better slice of web 1.0. Waifu of [[0037]].

* &gt;my sister is 13 and if shii ever looked at my sister in a sexual way i'd probably punch him  
* &gt;I know Shii in real life and he was pretty cool until he met my sister and he got all friendly with her and tried to give her a bunch of hugs and shit. She's 10. So I never let him come over to my house again. 
* &gt; **Shii said:**  
&gt; Ok, maybe 13 year olds aren't psychologically ready to have sex yet.
&gt;
&gt; The real question is, why should I care?

&gt; This is not a full list of fanart; literally hundreds of pictures have drawn. This is the very best of it, in my opinion. If you think there's something particularly good that I've missed, post it on my BBS.
