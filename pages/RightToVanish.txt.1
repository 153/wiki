## Why do you need a right to vanish?

If the Internet exhausts your patience, if you think you've said everything you need to say, if you screw up and don't want to bother covering your tail anymore... one day, you might need to just get the hell out of there. And when you do, you won't want anyone coming after you.

## How to defend your right to vanish

In case you ever need to do it, here are some tips for how to keep it your right.

* Don't give out personal information about you.
* Don't allow people to find you on other websites you use different names on.
* If you link to a website that you run, make sure it is a website you can pull down and dispose of effectively. 

## How to vanish

* Don't make a goodbye speech.
* Don't let anyone know where you're going.
* Get rid of all traces of you.
* Disappear into the night. 

You can also vanish in real life but it is much more difficult. For details, watch the movie Ghost World.
