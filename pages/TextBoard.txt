A textboard is a special kind of Japanese forum that is more like a guestbook than traditional forum software. They tend to be AnonyMous, not requiring an account to post.

Examples of TextBoard's:
- CGI scripts:
 - ShiiChan, php
 - KareHa, perl
 - TableCat, perl
  - EmanonBbs (patches / improvements)
 - IyagiBbs, python
