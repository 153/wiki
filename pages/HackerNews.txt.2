HackerNews

The reddit of programming and startups. Half of the content is good, half is terrible. Can you guess which community posts what? It has great design and a pretty good thing going in its comments section. I prefer it to Reddit's programming forum and SlashDot, anyway. 

If you think about it, the goal of finding the best news possible, especially in  the coding word, conflicts with the goal of startup culture (profit for a few). Those on ProgRider often refer to it as Hacker Jews.
