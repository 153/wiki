Tablecat is a person and website, located here:

http://tablecat.ipyo.heliohost.org/

His site has an awesome retro theme and some of his little Perl scripts. He also had a WikiWiki clone, but he closed it due to inactivity; the main attraction of his site is /lounge/, a continuation of the original WorldFourCh /lounge/, and the software that runs it, a TextBoard he wrote.
