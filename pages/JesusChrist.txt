A famed Jewish philosopher, said to have been born around the year 0. Err, wait, maybe "philosopher" isn't quite right? Is Jewish really all that right? Christian philosophy isn't at all like the teachings of Moses... well, he's a pretty important guy anyway, you probably know something about him.

Here are some quotes from the [Jefferson Bible](https://web.archive.org/web/20110110200407/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=JefJesu.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=all), an abridged version of the life and sayings of Jesus:

&gt; And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,

&gt; Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

&gt; Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.

&gt; Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.

&gt; Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.

&gt; Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.

&gt; Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.

&gt; Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.

&gt; Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

&gt; Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.

&gt; Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.

&gt; But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.

&gt; Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.

&gt; Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.

&gt; Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.

----
&gt; But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.

&gt; And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.

&gt; And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.

&gt; It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:

&gt; But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.

&gt; Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:

&gt; But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:

&gt; Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.

&gt; Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.

&gt; But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.

&gt; Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:

&gt; But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.

&gt; And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.


&gt; Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.

&gt; Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.

&gt; But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you, and persecute you;

&gt; That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.

&gt; For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?

&gt; And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?

&gt; And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.

&gt; But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.

&gt; Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.
