Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889 - 1951) was a philosopher interested in MetaPhysics, LogicalThinking, and EpisteMology. He wrote two greatly influential books, the Tractatus Logico-philosophicus (writing on logic and philosophy), which sought to define the scope and methods of philosophy, eliminating many of its problems in the process, as well as Philosophical Investigations, which was meant to cast doubt on what he said in the previous work.
