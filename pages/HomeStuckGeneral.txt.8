Homestuck General was a series of threads on 4chans's /co/ (Comics and Cartoons) board. While originally intended for discussion of homestuck in a dedicated thread, they soon devolved into insane shitposting.

Keep in mind that any discussion on HomoSuck is shit by default, because it is literally a comic about **autistic teenagers roleplaying**.

## History

* (2009-2010) Homestuck threads existed on /co/, albeit without the moniker. They would flood the board every time there was an update.
* (2010-2014) Around 10/25, the name "Homestuck General" first appeared. (Source: [[Zwid]]) The threads continued until 2014, spouting horrible memes and tripfaggotry.
* (2014-06-27) A modpost appeared in the last thread, announcing that HSG threads would no longer be allowed. Attempts were made at migrating elsewhere on the board (and notably, a long thread on /s4s/ was made).
* (2014-2015) HSG temporarily migrated to ipgd's dumbgarbage site and resided there for a while.
* (2015-onwards) HSG has since moved to 8chan's /homosuck/ which is entirely dedicated to hosting the general. In addition, homestuck threads are allowed on /co/ again, but it has not come close to the insane stream of un-content it was before the ban.
