IpAddress
1453432818 Anonymous
An IP address is a computer's (usually a router's) InterNet address at a given time. IPv4 addresses come in the format ###.###.###.###, from 0.0.0.0 -- 255.255.255.255. IPv6 (the current version of the Internet Protocol) addresses come in the format XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX, from 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 -- FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF.  Most computers only have one IP address, and most IP addresses refer to a single computer at a point in time. For this reason, they provide the closest thing to an identity when users are otherwise AnonyMous. 

Most consumers have dynamic IPs, meaning that their IP address can change. However, the ISP which connects people to the InterNet generally stores the MacAddress associated with a given IP, so you are not anonymous to them, even if your public internet address changes.
