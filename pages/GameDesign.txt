I'm creating a little game in Python.

## Stats
Stats are:
- attack 
- defense
- wisdom 
- speed

Other stats are:
- Stat points (5 * level#, +5 for player / bosses)
- HP (attack + defense + level)

*Attack* and *defense* form a natural pair, representing physical condition. When combined, they form *HP*. 

### Attacking 
`(attack# * (random#, between 0 and level)) vs (defense# * (random#, between 0 and level))`

If the attack hits:
` (random#, between 0 and (previous result# // 2)) + any item/magic attack boosts`

### Defending
Instead of attacking, a user can choose to defend. This makes their defense attempt (level * 0.5 defense). It can deflect some attacks, but not all.
