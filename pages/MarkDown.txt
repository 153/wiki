MarkDown
1463711849 Anonymous
Markdown is a cool formatting language that's simpler and more intuitive than HTML and BbCode. ThisWiki, along with sites like GitHub and RedDit, use Markdown so that plain text editing is an attractive alternative to WYSIWYG editors. We have our own Markdown renderer powered by Mistune in Python.

Some Markdown works on here, like:

#### Headers (on their own line, prefixed with \#\#\#)
* lists (prefix each line with \*)
* *italics* and **bold** (wrap \* or \*\* around words)
* MD-style [links](http://google.com/)
* horizontal lines (&lt;hr&gt; is \-\-\-\- on its own line)
* `code blocks`, by \`wrapping text in backticks\`
&gt; quotes or indents by prefixing a line with &gt;
* and other mysteries
