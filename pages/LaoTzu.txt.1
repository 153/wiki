LaoTzu
1453622509 Anonymous
Old Chinese sage who lived from 601 BCE - 531 BCE. Unlike other philosophers, as a mystic, he was hostile to language. He kicked off the school of Daoism, a school of Eastern philosophy with some similarities to the teachings of GautamaBuddha.

For a good idea of what his philosophy's all about, try reading the full text of the [Dao De Ching](http://www.taoism.net/ttc/complete.htm), his magnum opus. 

&gt;The Tao that can be expressed is not the eternal Tao; The name that can be defined is not the unchanging name.  

&gt; Non-existence is called the antecedent of heaven and earth; Existence is the mother of all things.

&gt; From eternal non-existence, therefore, we serenely observe the mysterious beginning of the Universe; From eternal existence we clearly see the apparent distinctions.  

&gt; These two are the same in source and become different when manifested.  

&gt; This sameness is called profundity. Infinite profundity is the gate whence comes the beginning of all parts of the Universe.

&gt; A journey of a thousand miles started with a first step.

&gt; The Tao is like a bellows:

&gt;it is empty yet infinitely capable.

&gt;The more you use it, the more it produces;

&gt;the more you talk of it, the less you understand.
