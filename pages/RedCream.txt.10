RedCream

RedCream came of age on the ancient usernet where he was given the title RedCream due to being able to advise people on why they had bloody cum. This was because of his higher education background in nursing with a physics minor. He is a Chinese kiddy-fiddler with a shit sense of humor

Nowadays he sometimes hangs out on TextBoard's but not always. You can occasionally find him at TableCat''s /lounge/, ProgRider, TinyChan or using the moniker "Violent Simians Guy" on 4Chan's /sci/. 

He is a master of the memes. Notable RedCream memes include:

* Boompsy
* goatfinger
* the fuck on
* admit your role
* pumblenuts
* Threadshitter

It is estimated that he was responsible for at least 10% of the memes on the original /lounge/ at World4Ch, and presumably very little is still unknown about the accuracy of those figures by now. 


Dread Pirate Roberts from the movie 'The Princess Bride' revealed during the course of the story that a series of individuals are wealthy enough to retire. Could this same thing apply to RedCream? But for what reason? Maybe because the name RedCream has been circling the web since the late 80s.  

RedCream cannot be considered a 'tripfag', since he never posts with a trip. 

RedCream has been missing from TableCat''s /lounge/ for a while now. We fear for his innocent soul.
