MarkDown

Markdown is a cool formatting language that's simpler and more intuitive than HTML and BBcode. ThisWiki, along with sites like GitHub and http://reddit.com/ , use Markdown so that plain text editing is an attractive alternative to WYSIWYG editors. 

Some Markdown works on here, like:

### Headers,

* lists
* **bold**
* *italics*
* [links](http://google.com/)
* horizontal lines
* and other mysteries
