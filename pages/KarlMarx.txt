*Workers of the world, unite!*


Karl Marx was a really badass dude. Believe me.

From [Squashed Philosophers](http://sqapo.com/communist.htm), abridged text from the *Communist Manifesto:*
&gt; A spectre is haunting Europe- the spectre of Communism. All the Powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Czar, French Radicals and German police-spies. Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as Communistic by its opponents in power?
&gt; 1. Communism is acknowledged to be itself a Power.
&gt; 2. Communists should openly publish their views...

&gt; #### BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANS
&gt; The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles. Modern bourgeois society has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society. The manufacturing system has replaced corporate guilds, the industrial middle class by giant industry and machinery. The State is now a committee for managing the affairs of the bourgeoisie. The division of labour and "cash" has made physician, lawyer, priest, poet and scientist into wage labourers. All, even family, is reduced to mere money relations. The country has been subjected to enormous cities. Commercial crises, even over-production, break out. There is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industry. The bourgeoisie have forged the weapons that bring death to itself. Proletarians must sell themselves as a commodity, they have been made an appendage of the machine, therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases. The workers begin to form unions, riots break out. Occasionally, the workers are victorious, but their real success is in making themselves into a proletarian revolutionary class. The bourgeoisie produces is its own grave-diggers.

&gt; #### PROLETARIANS AND COMMUNISTS
&gt; Communists have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole. Just as the French Revolution abolished feudal property, Communism may be summed up: Abolition of private property, heavy progressive taxes, abolition of inheritance, centralisation in the State of all: banking, communication and transport, factories and instruments of production. Equal liability of all to labour. Establishment of industrial armies. Free education &amp; abolition of child labour.
In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.

&gt; #### WORKING MEN OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE!
