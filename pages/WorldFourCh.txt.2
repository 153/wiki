An AnonyMous TextBoard website that ran using ShiiChan, from 2004 until 2015 (?). 

In the beginning, it was kind of like a clone of TwoChannel, with the following boards:

**Anime &amp; Manga 

 Books 

 Comics &amp; Cartoons 

 Computers 

 Food 

 Video Games 

 Imageboard Discussion 

 Foreign Language 

 Lounge
Music 

 World News 

 Politics 

 Programming 


 Science &amp; Math

 SJIS Room 

 Sports 

Technology 

 Television &amp; Film 

 News for VIP**

/books/ and /vip/ were the only two consistently forced AnonyMous boards. Near the end, because MrVacBob cared less about moderating than [[Shii]] did, it succumbed to a captcha and was dead.
