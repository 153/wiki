An AnonyMous TextBoard script which was written in PHP and well in use for many years (2004 - 2015) on FourChan''s WorldFourCh subsite, developed by [[Shii]] and maintained by MrVacBob. Its syntax was BbCode. It had a CopyLeft license but there is no reason to use it now, because KareHa, TableCat, and IyagiBbs are much better.

Often called ShitChan by its users.
