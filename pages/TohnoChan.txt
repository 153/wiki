Tohno-chan is a weird ass AnonyMous ImageBoard, located at http://tohno-chan.com/. According to the FAQ, its name means:

- True
- Otaku (anime fan/obsessive nerd)
- Hikikomori (shut-in / agoraphobe)
- NEET (unemployed and not in school)
- Organization
- Channel

It's pretty much what it says on the tin, but it also has a board notable for taking the whole JapaneseAnimation thing a step further, called [/mai/ waifu](http://tohno-chan.com/mai/). What is a waifu?
