KareHa

Kareha is a PublicDomain TextBoard script with AnonyMous posting by a guy named Dag. It has different design philosophies in mind than IyagiBbs and TableCat''s BBS; but, it's pretty great and easy to use. Try it out if you want to make your own board.

It's like, at least 5 years old by now. Written in perl. The latest (last?) version was 3.1.4, on 2009.04.16.

Hidden features:
- Make your email "sage" to not bump 
- Make your name "fusianasan" to print your IP address
- Make a bunch of inoffensive threads about pointless topics; the board draws to a halt when users try to make a new post or reply on a board with many posts
- If IDs are on, making your email "sage" often renames your ID to "heaven"
- You can reference replies in ranges. Example: Clicking &gt;&gt;33-37,42,44-46 would go to a page that only shows replies 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 42, 44, 45, 46. 
- There's a shitty ImageBoard in it that you should avoid using. 
- You can subscribe by RSS so that you don't need to check the board to see whether there's any new threads
- You can hide the date, like SageruOrg, or the email box, like FourByThirteen, for a spin on the vanilla board. Or, you can set the date to '2ch-sep93' to copy DQN.
