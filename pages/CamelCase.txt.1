CamelCase
1452261489 Anonymous
Camel case, or two capitalized words joined together (named for the "hump"), is a very ugly way of printing text.

Some ProgrammingLanguage's, like JavaLanguage, make heavy use of it. 

ThisWiki also makes use of it.

To link to a page, just enter a page title joined together (like PageTitle). This creates a link to the page if it exists, and a link to create the page if it doesn't. If you want to add an s or es or something to an end of a word without linking it, type (for example) KareHa`s (using the normal quotation mark). The wiki is semi-sentient -- beware!
