Homestuck general is the collective term for a series of threads, from FourChan''s /co/. Although the threads were supposedly for discussing the WebComic, they soon devolved into shitposting, the likes of which has yet to be seen.

##The first HSG (2010-2014)

The first threads named "Homestuck General" first started appearing around October of 2010. Notably 2012 is commonly regarded as the "golden age" of HSG.  
On the 27th of June 2014, a modpost was made in the last thread, announcing that HSG threads would no longer be allowed on 4chan. Alternatives were sought; a single thread was made on /s4s/ (and various on /b/), but in the end, HSG had been banished from 4chan. 

##Dumbgarbage (2014-2015)

[[ipgd]]'s site hosted the threads for some time after the ban. Nothing special happened here. Some dude archived the site with thumbnails.

##/homosuck/ (2015 onwards)

The current proper incarnation of HSG. Has some tripfags, also did gristmas 2015. Goes through like 2-3 threads a day.

##HST

The other present-day incarnation of HSG, on /co/. Way less frequent, way less spam, way less fun.
