Iyagi is a TextBoard written by FourByThirteen, hosted at http://4x13.net/bbs/ (source: http://github.com/153/iyagi-bbs)  The name means "chat" or "story" in Korean nida.

It has light rules, but is meant to be a place where people can post their mind about things that interest them. You can easily share music, videos, and snippets of code. No registration is required, and there is TripCode support. Please come and chat freely about whatever's on your mind~

It's PublicDomain and allows for Anonymous posting, which is pretty cool. Unlike KareHa, it has stickies, and is slightly more mobile friendly. If anyone would like to contribute -- themes, especially, would be nice, or your takes on the patterns used -- feel free to speak! 

You can use `[yt]youtube url[/yt]` to embed YouTube videos, `[spoiler]spoilered text[/spoiler]` if your text needs to be partially hidden for whatever reason, `[code]` and `[aa]` tags to format code or ascii art, and indicate quoted text with FourChan-style green text.
