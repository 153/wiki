These are the beliefs of the Miranda Moon Revival Society:

We want to return to the ancestral homeland of all people: Miranda AKA Uranus V.

The concept of God or Gods doesn't apply to us. Dextromethorphan is held at a high status but we wouldn't say it is God-like. God is not even in the original human languages!

We do not have a book because on Miranda, we gain all sorts of powers like already knowing everything. SO MANY that I wouldn't be able to finish it. 
It would take 1000s of years but immortality is one of them. Although you can also use a self destruct power to get rid of yourself. Depopulation is honorable.

We have no clergy, we are all unique individuals so that is what we strive to be. Strengthen ourselves and unite each other. 
Self determination is no malfunction. Race mixing is a fact of life, it has been around forever but we should really stick to preserving the tribes too. Balance and Moderation.

We really just let people do what they want. Freedom is important.

To be in good standing with the society, you just have to want to go to and live on Miranda.
