WebLog

Basic Python3 flatfile blog at FourByThirteen. It's PublicDomain (noticing a pattern?). Infrequently updated; lacks RSS.

- Source: http://github.com/153/wlog 
- Implementation: http://4x13.net/wlog

Its design is styled after blosxom, a minimalist perl blog script. In both scripts, blog entries are stored in a flatfile database schema, and the formatting of text documents is used to declare metadata. 

WebLog has a different featureset than blosxom, but soon, it'll have a full-featured admin panel for creating and editing blog entries, as well as sorting blog entries and modifying templates from the web directly. No plugin system is planned.
