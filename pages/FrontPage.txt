This is the front page of ThisWiki. Its format is roughly based
on WikiWiki by C2. 

It supports:
* Formatting via MarkDown
* Anonymous editing
* CamelCase for internal linking
* Page backups and changelogs

Try making an article of your own by following a dead link, creating a link to a non-existing page, or by modifying the URL field. Test your edits / spam the SandBox.
