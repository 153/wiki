FrontPage

This is the front page of the wiki. Its format is roughly based
on WikiWiki by C2. 

It supports:
* lists, _italics_, __bold__ via MarkDown
* AnonyMous editing
* CamelCase for internal linking
* Link coloring
* Page backups and changelogs

It will support:
* searching the list of page titles
* a "recent changes" page
* IP logs

Try viewing the pages on AnonyMous or ThisWiki, or make an article of your own, by following a dead link, creating a link to a non-existing page, or by modifying the URL field.

You can [view all pages](?m=link), or view all categories at CategoryCategory, too.
