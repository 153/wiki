PublicDomain
1451899855 Anonymous
Public domain software is like open source or free software, but even more open and more free. 

Some software licenses that put software into the public domain include the CC0, Do Whatever The Fuck You Want With It license, and several others. However, "public domain" is a license in itself, in practice.

My rational for it -- people are going to copy what they want, how they want; you may as well let them.
