Very hip and cool AnonyMous textboard about computer programming. It original ran on WorldFourCh, FourChan''s textboard. It notably supported BbCode but had a very awful software called ShiiChan. The current version also supports BBcode, unlike other TextBoard scripts.

ProgRider is powered by TableCat''s BBS script, as is the fake /prog/ at https://dis.4ct.org/prog/.
