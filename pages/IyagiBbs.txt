Iyagi is a TextBoard written by FourByThirteen, hosted at http://4x13.net/bbs/ (source: http://github.com/153/iyagi-bbs)  The name means "chat" or "story" in Korean nida.

It has light rules, but is meant to be a place where people can post their mind about things that interest them. You can easily share music, videos, and snippets of code. No registration is required, and there is TripCode support. Please come and chat freely about whatever's on your mind~

It's PublicDomain and allows for Anonymous posting, which is pretty cool. Unlike KareHa, ShiiChan, and (to my knowledge) TableCat BBS, it has stickies, another improvement, and is slightly more mobile friendly. 

If anyone would like to contribute -- themes, especially, would be nice, or your takes on the patterns used -- feel free to speak! 

**Tip:** use the AtomFeed's to get board updates!

You can use `[yt]youtube url[/yt]` to embed YouTube videos, `[spoiler]spoilered text[/spoiler]` if your text needs to be partially hidden for whatever reason, `[code]` and `[aa]` tags to format code or ascii art, and indicate quoted text with FourChan-style green text.

### Setup and tips for admins
Falling in line with UnixPhilosophy, its database is completely flatfile. First off, modify index.py3 to have variables that match your website's information. Then, open/modify list.txt to change how posts are listed and how their metadata is shown; open the filename specified in the list to open a textfile containing the posts themselves, one post per line. 

View http://4x13.net/bbs/threads/ to get an idea of the backend.

| | Mode  | Effect 
|:- | -:| |
| Normal | 0 |
| Locked | 1 | No more posts can be added.
| Stickied | 2 | Stay at the top of the thread index
| Stickylocked | 3 | Stay at the top of the thread list, but allow no more posts
| Permasaged | 4 | Users posts can't bump the thread, allowing it to sink to the bottom of the thread index and die from obscurity.

list.txt basic format (one thread per line):

&gt; unix timestamp of thread creation &gt;&lt; last post time (in fancy ISO 8601) &gt;&lt; thread title &gt;&lt; reply count &gt;&lt; thread_mode

---
unixtime.txt basic format (one post per line):
&gt; (line 1) thread title

If you want to set a mode to a thread, after setting its mode in list.txt (0-4), open the thread and change its title to look like this for a permasaged thread: 

&gt; thread title [&lt; 4

The "[&lt;" tells the software that a special mode will be used. 

Then, each post in the thread is a line following the first line, and looks like this:
&gt; (line 2-...?) name &gt;&lt; fancy iso timestamp &gt;&lt; sage? &gt;&lt; comment

list.txt sorts threads by their bump order, while ips.txt sorts post by their time of appearance. ips.txt looks like this:
&gt; IpAddress | thread filename | the post's line, as shown in the previous example

By checking ips.txt, the admin can easily moderate posts based on their content, date, location, and IP address. Meanwhile, users can view the list easily with a pretty webpage generated by the script, such as [4x13's list](http://4x13.net/bbs/?m=list), which copies the functionality of subback seen at places such as [/dqn/](http://4-ch.net/dqn/subback.html). If a moderator wants to hide a thread but not delete it, he can simply remove it from the list.
