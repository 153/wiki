4-ch is a textboard that could be described as the 2ch of the West because of how many boards it has (although it doesn't come close to the actual number of boards 2ch has). It's been around since 2005/2006.

The only boards that get regularly posted on these days are: DQN, Internet Addicts, Net Culture, and General.

It used to be run by Squeeks, but since 2014 someone called bps has replaced him. Not much is known about bps other than that he lives in Denmark and grew up in a town near Oxford in England. 'bps' stands for Battle Programmer Shirase, an anime from 2003 about a computer programmer.
