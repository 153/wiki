MagicalThinking
1464317176 Anonymous
A common trait among people with MentalIllness'es is the
belief that two unalike things share a causal link. Some people
may take strange (or even common) occurances to have complex
symbolic significance.

Belief in fortune telling, Jung's *synchronicity,*
or superstition are regular instances of magical thinking.
Prayer could also be considered to be related to delusional
thought processes like this.

.... will add more info later.
