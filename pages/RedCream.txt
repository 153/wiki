RedCream

RedCream is a Chinese kiddy-fiddler and a god among men. Unlike other namefags, he hangs out on TextBoard's. You can usually find him at TableCat''s /lounge/ or at ProgRider. He is a master of the goatfinger.

It is estimated that he was responsible for at least 30% of the posts on the original /lounge/ at WorldFourCh, but very little is still known about him. Biggest mysteries concerning RedCream:

- Is he one person, or many?
- What is his motivation for dominating lounges around the net?
- When did RedCream originate?

Someone please rewrite this shit wiki entry later.

You know Dread Pirate Roberts from the movie 'The Princess Bride'?  It's revealed during the course of the story that Roberts is not one man, but a series of individuals who pass the name and reputation to a chosen successor once they are wealthy enough to retire.

I was thinking that this same thing could apply to RedCream. But for what reason would he pass on his name and reputation to a successor?

Also, I know from memory that the name RedCream has been circling the web since the late 90s.  

I would also like to point out that RedCream cannot be considered a 'tripfag', since he never posts with a trip. He is a 'namefag', if anything. (I fixed it and changed it to namefag. Happy now?)
