HackerNews

The reddit of programming and startups. Half of the content is good, half is terrible. Can you guess which community posts what? It has great design and a pretty good thing going in its comments section. I prefer it to Reddit's programming forum and SlashDot, anyway.

If you think about it, the goal of finding the best news possible conflicts with the goal of letting a minority of organizations succeed financially because they want more money, all other things aside.
