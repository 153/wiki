Iyagi is a TextBoard written by FourByThirteen, hosted at http://4x13.net/misc/bbs/ (source: http://github.com/153/iyagi-bbs)  The name means "chat" or "story" in Korean.

It's PublicDomain and allows for Anonymous posting, which is pretty cool. Unlike KareHa, it has stickies, and is slightly more mobile friendly. If anyone would like to contribute -- themes, especially, would be nice, or your takes on the patterns used -- feel free to speak!
