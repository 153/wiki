Sageru, or 6ch, is a TextBoard running KareHa located at http://sageru.org/ and has been around for some years. It also has a delightful little chat called JayPee, located at http://irc.sageru.org/ #jp or irc://irc.sageru.org/jp . Check it out :)

It's ran by MeltingWax.

The rules at the top of the page used to be user editable.
For a short time in 2016 there were bees.
