Very hip and cool continuation AnonyMous textboard about ComputerProgramming. It original ran on WorldFourCh, FourChan''s textboard, written by a guy named [[Shii]] and later kept alive by MrVacBob. It supported BbCode but had a very awful software called ShiiChan. ProgRider is powered by TableCat's BBS script, as is the fake prog at https://dis.4ct.org/prog/.
