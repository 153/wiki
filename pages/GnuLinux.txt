GnuLinux

Open source operating system. Linux runs on everything from supercomputers to cell phones, to TVs, and GNU/Linux can serve a nice experience to people who learn to love it. The creator, Linus Torvalds, spends his days in a garage near PortlandOregon. A Linux distribution (distro) is a common term used to refer to a collection of tools, including, most importantly, Linux, and is something like a flavor of GnuLinux as a whole. GnuNotUnix powers most distros, outside of the kernel. 

The author of this article thinks that Slackware is the best Linux distro. Grab a Linux distro like Gparted or something, and create a new, blank partition for your Linux-based OS using that, then install Slackware into that. I would recommend trying a Live CD of it first if you use newer / weirder hardware, especially no-name consumer laptops (their wireless cards are funny). It's fun to mess around with. Ubuntu has a weaker learning curve.

The computer that sent you this webpage is probably running a Linux distro of some sort. If you're reading this on one, thumbs up from me!
