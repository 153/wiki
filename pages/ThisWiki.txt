This wiki is based on WikiWiki and allows Anonymous editing. However, it's only based on how WikiWiki seems; I have no experience with it past viewing pages. Unlike WikiWiki, this site is PublicDomain and open to editing. 

Spammers be warned: IPs are logged and backups are kept!

#### Formatting
* Use CamelCase to make links! If a page doesn't exist, a link to create it appears.
* An empty line followed by  "\-\-\-\-" make a horizontal line. They're good for indicating a new author, a new section, etc.
* XSS is blocked, don't try that 13 year old crap
* Try MarkDown for everything else. (\*italics\*), (\*\*bold\*\*), (\[link\]\(url\)), etc

What should go here:
* interesting content 
* original content 
* opinion pieces, advice
* internet culture
* articles on places you go online?
* Text-heavy content 

What shouldn't go here:
* spam
* NSFW stuff
* crappy edits
* big chunks of other people's writing 
* image dumps
* shitposting
