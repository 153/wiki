This wiki is based on WikiWiki and allows AnonyMous editing. Unlike WikiWiki, this site is PublicDomain and open to editing.  I hope that it can be used by the people who use the TextBoard on this website. 

Spammers be warned: IPs are logged and backups are kept!

### Features
* MarkDown editing 
* AnonyMous / pseudonymous editing and page creation
* Mobile and IE friendly
* Categories, indexing, backlinking 
* Backups and recent changes (being added)

----
### Formatting
* Use CamelCase to make links! If a page doesn't exist, a link to create it appears.
* An empty line followed by  "\-\-\-\-" make a horizontal line. They're good for indicating a new author, a new section, etc.
* XSS is blocked, don't try that 13 year old crap
* Try MarkDown for everything else. (\*italics\*), (\*\*bold\*\*), (\[link\]\(url\)), etc

----
