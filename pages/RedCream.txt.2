RedCream is a Chinese kiddy-fiddler and a god among men. Unlike other tripfags, he hangs out on TextBoard's. You can usually find him at TableCat''s /lounge/ or at ProgRider. He is a master of the goatfinger.

It is estimated that he was responsible for at least 30% of the posts on the original /lounge/ at WorldFourCh, but very little is still known about him. Biggest mysteries concerning RedCream:

- Is he one person, or many?
- What is his motivation for dominating lounges around the net?
- When did RedCream originate?

Someone please rewrite this shit wiki entry later.
