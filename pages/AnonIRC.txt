**anonIRC** is a cool new network based on a new AnonIRCd created by [[tee]].

It can be found at [z.1chan.us:6667](http://i.imgur.com/30aKL6R.jpg) (6697 for SSL).

###Literally all that ever happens:
&gt;`* Anonymous7 (Anon@IRC) has left`    
&gt;`* Anonymous7 (Anon@IRC) has joined`   
&gt;&lt;`Anonymous`&gt;  `hi`  


###Channels
* **\#** - The default and most populous channel. Created by accident when the server stopped and everyone autojoined # in addition to #lobby upon reconnect.
* **\#jp** - JayPee embassy. Few users.
* **\#anonirc** - Meta channel.
* **\#lobby** - The ex-main channel. Dead.
