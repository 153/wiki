Georg Hegel lived in Germany from 1770 CE - 1831 CE. He was the successor to the school of MetaPhysics that ImmanuelKant began and is seen as representing one branch of German Idealism, contrasted with ArthurSchopenhauer, who interpreted the Kantian ThingInItself in a different way. Ironically, Hegel's biggest influence was on KarlMarx, who was very anti-"Spirit".

Known for his dry language / general opacity and unreadable paragraphs. He kickstarted the school of ContinentalPhilosophy. 

* &gt;The force of mind is only as great as its expression; its depth only as deep as its power to expand and lose itself. 
* &gt;The heart is everywhere, and each part of the organism is only the specialized force of the heart itself.
* &gt;What experience and history teach is this -- that nations and governments have never learned anything from history, or acted upon any lessons they might have drawn from it. 
* &gt;Nothing great in the World has been accomplished without passion.
