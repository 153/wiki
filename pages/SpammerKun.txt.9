Spammer-kun is a fucking retard who keeps filling WorldTwoCh with insane racial spam, often times related to Basques.

Suspects
--------

###[[Tokiko]] 

&gt;**Arguments for:**
 - Activity seems to parallel his in a few interesting ways.
 - Already aware of the site.
 - Appears to have knowledge of personal (IRC) conversations between 
   [[0037]] and [[Ticks]].
 - Consumes the right combination of mind-altering substances to write 
   ceaseless pages of bullshit.
 - Experienced in evading bans elsewhere...

&gt;**Arguments against:**
 - When have we ever known Toki to keep something going for more than 
   three months?
 - Parallels in activity could be entirely coincidental.
 - Not known for being that crazy.
 - Does he seriously have the time for this? Counterpoint: Probably.
 - Not racist



###[[Some Random Idiot]]

&gt;**Arguments for:**
 - Writing style is unique, to say the least... and yet he never breaks 
   character.

&gt;**Arguments against:**
 - How the fuck did he find WorldTwoCh? And why does he continue to 
   post there?




###KillSushi

&gt;**Arguments for:**
 - He/she/shii/it has the word Basque in his tripcode.
 - He definitely seem retarded enough to do it.
 - They both seem to write code.
 - He's already known for spamming SageruOrg with an insane rant about
   AveryMorrow once.

&gt;**Arguments against:**
 - Sushi claims to be Basque, while spammer-kun hates Basques.
 - [All of his posts so far have been on SageruOrg, not WorldTwoCh.
   Counterpoint: He's mentioned both [[0037]] and WorldTwoCh in his
   posts.] Ignore this, he's posted on WorldTwoCh with a tripcode now.
 - He could be Tokiko. Just who is he, anyway?

&gt;**Furthermore:**
 - He joined #world2ch (now owned by Tokiko) after this article was
   mentioned in #jp.
  *(I've been going there on and off for a while now,
   just to see if it's become less dead. Nothing suspicious there. 
   -Sushi-kun~~)*



###[[0037]]

&gt;**Arguments for:**
 - He may be spamming his own site to make it look like someone 
   actually visits it.

&gt;**Arguments against:**
 - He definitely isn't retarded enough to waste his time on spamming
   when he could be yelling at children.
 - [[0037]] doesn't seem particularly interested in writing racial 
   rants.
