Sorry, I just wanted the headings to be matching.

*(No need to be sorry, if you hadn't changed the headings to match I would have; non-matching headings really piss me off  -KillSushi~)*

Hi KS, I like your story!

*Which story are you referring to? "Tokiko goes shopping"? If you actually enjoyed that crap there is probably something deeply wrong with you. Not even I enjoyed that shit and I'm the one who wrote it.  -KillSushi~*

what is small talk

*According to Google, small talk is "polite conversation about unimportant or uncontroversial matters, especially as engaged in on social occasions." It can also refer to an object-oriented, dynamically typed, reflective programming language.  -KillSushi~*

still, i'm curious: what the FUCK was going though your head when you made that

*To be honest, I just felt like using the words "Avery Morrow's The Sacred Science of Avery Morrow" in a story. Nice to see someone actually made an article here just for it. I have no clue what I was thinking for the rest of it.  -KillSushi~*

r u gay

*Yes, and I want to fuck the guy who keeps editing this to make me sound gay. -KillSushi~*
