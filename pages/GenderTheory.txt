Gender - what is it?

Really, gender is just the social manifestation of the sexes.

99% of people are male or female. The existence of abnormalities (intersexed people) and psychological abnormalities (transgendered people) is not just cause for denying the biological reality of the two sexes. 

Why do these aspects of masculinity and femininity manifest in society? 

Because men and women want to fuck.
