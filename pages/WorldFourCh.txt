An AnonyMous TextBoard website that ran using ShiiChan, from 2004 until 2015 (?). 

In the beginning, it was kind of like a clone of TwoChannel, with 15 boards or something. I was never too into it, but I recall that /books/ and /vip/ were the only two consistently forced AnonyMous boards on 4chan. Near the end, because MrVacBob cared less about moderating than [[Shii]] did, it succumbed to spam. A captcha was added near the end, but it didn't help.
