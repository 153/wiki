An AnonyMous TextBoard website that ran on a subdomain of FourChan, using ShiiChan, from 2004 until 2015 (?). 

In the beginning, it was kind of like a clone of TwoChannel, with the following boards:

* Anime &amp; Manga 
* Books 
* Comics &amp; Cartoons 
* Computers 
* Food 
* Video Games 
* Imageboard Discussion 
* Foreign Language 
* Lounge
* Music 
* World News 
* Politics 
* Programming 
* Science &amp; Math
* SJIS Room 
* Sports 
* Technology
* Television &amp; Film 
* News for VIP

/books/ and /vip/ were the only two consistently forced AnonyMous boards. Near the end, because MrVacBob cared less about moderating than [[Shii]] did, it succumbed to a captcha and was dead.
