Philosophy, in Greek, is the *love of wisdom.* It's a branch of academic culture that deals with judgment in all its nuances. Its subdivisions include LogicalThinking, MetaPhysics, [[Epistemology]], [[Aesthetics]], EthicalPhilosophy, and PoliticalPhilosophy, traditionally; these days, nearly every subject has its own branch of philosophy, and the subdivisions of philosophy as a field in itself are uncountable.
