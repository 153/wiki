Double Brackets
1453258409 Anonymous
Not every occasion calls for the usage of CamelCase for a page title. Short words or abbreviations, in particular, stand out. Unlike WikiWiki, ThisWiki allows a workaround: to link to these eccentric pages, wrap a word in [[Double Brackets]]. 

One thing to watch out for: this is a *case sensitive* operation! Make sure to preview the page before clicking submit, if you do this, or check the [all pages](?m=link) directory to confirm a page's proper name.
