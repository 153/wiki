The Internet is a series of tubes! 

Some places on the Internet, like TextBoard's and ImageBoard's, have articles about them on ThisWiki. Some people and websites on the internet have articles about them, too. Maybe you can find some of them if you look for them...?

A lot of wild things happen out in Cyberspace. It's a dangerous internet out there, and happiness is a warm gun, you know.
