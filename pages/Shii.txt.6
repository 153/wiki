&gt; I have a picture of Shii on my computer. I always thought he was cute... until I heard his voice &gt;_&gt;

There's a gold thread about him on SomethingAwful, some scandal about his alleged pedophilia, that drove him into a fury so great that it caused him to leave the world of traditional boards in lieu of AnonyMous ImageBoard's and TextBoard's (he even made his own, ShiiChan, which powered WorldFourCh).  Formerly had a homepage at http://shii.org/. RIP a better slice of web 1.0. Waifu of [[0037]].

&gt; my sister is 13 and if shii ever looked at my sister in a sexual way i'd probably punch him 

From Shii's old blog:
&gt;&gt; if we do im going to sing "funny bunny" by none other than The Pillows! and im going to dress like lain
&gt;
&gt;&gt; omg ive read about an 11 yr old girl named Nevada and she killed her friend with a box cutter. i love this image of her tho: [img-nevada]
&gt;
&gt;&gt; she's going to be my new theme for livejournal o.0 learn more about her here: http://shii.org/nevada
&gt;
&gt;&gt; i wanna cosplay her now &gt;.&lt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; well thats all byby!
