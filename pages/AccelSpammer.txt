Accelspammer was a notorious shitposter who spammed threads. Toumaspammer, the guy who originally made the script that let him do it, sold him out (And almost his entire IP list) to the mods. Then the mods tried to institute a loli-ban. People went berserk over the injustice and Accelspammer, even though he was crippled, took on the job of spamming all threads with loli. He burned through every single IP he had left to overwhelm the mods and bring loli back to /a/. It was a noble sacrifice that undid the evil he once did.
