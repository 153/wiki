This is the front page of the wiki. Its format is roughly based
on WikiWiki by C2. 

It supports:
* Formatting via MarkDown
* AnonyMous editing
* CamelCase for internal linking
* Page backups and changelogs
* **New** IP logging added and recent changes added
* **New** Linking via [ [Double Brackets] ] added  
 * example: [[SKE48]], [[Shii]]

It lacks:
* Automatic link associating - link "database" is updated on page writes only
* Admin account (feature?)
* Proper article accounts (page count inflation)

Try viewing the pages on AnonyMous or ThisWiki, or make an article of your own, by following a dead link, creating a link to a non-existing page, or by modifying the URL field.
