True Anonymity is rare online; IpAddress'es are nearly always 
logged, and registration is often required on top of that. 
Forced registration means forced identity, as websites making use of
registration systems usually tie one account to one person.

TextBoard's and ImageBoard's are special, in that users are
anonymous by default, and they do not even allow registration.
Their limited use of user-tracking (in storing IPs) has marginal
impact on the free flow of discussion. 

ThisWiki adopts that practice by also not requiring editors to create
an account. However, IpAddress'es are logged. See the FrontPage for 
more details. There's no reason not to post AnonyMous'ly if you want to
discuss something you feel is controversial, but anonymity does not 
give you permission to be obnoxious, either

Anonymous is known to be a jerk. This may be due to the Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory (GIFT), which states:

    Normal person + Anonymity + Audience
                 ==
            Total Fuckwad

Others argue that....

     Identity + Audience + Informal Chat 
                 ==
             Circlejerking

Take your pick. With Anonymity, you at least have a right to vanish. 

A lot of places where Anon hangs out are considered to be worst places on the internet. You have been warned.  These include FourChan and SageruOrg.
