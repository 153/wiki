*(No need to be sorry, if you hadn't changed the headings to match I would have; non-matching headings really piss me off  -KillSushi~)*

Hi KS, I like your story!

*Which story are you referring to? "Tokiko goes shopping"? If you actually enjoyed that crap there is probably something deeply wrong with you. Not even I enjoyed that shit and I'm the one who wrote it.  -KillSushi~*

what is small talk

*According to Google, small talk is "polite conversation about unimportant or uncontroversial matters, especially as engaged in on social occasions." It can also refer to an object-oriented, dynamically typed, reflective programming language.  -KillSushi~*
