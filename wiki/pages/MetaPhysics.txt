MetaPhysics
1451889966 Anonymous
Metaphysics is a branch of CategoryPhilosophy which deals with the complex nature of reality, the world, the mind, things, being, space, time, and other topics.

Many religious traditions have been known to have interests in metaphysics, both for its own sake and as the means to a political end. When you can assert that something is divine, i.e., from God, it makes it difficult for common people to call something BullShit, even if they know it is. 

Developments in technology have aided metaphysics by reducing some of its philosophical problems to merely empirical ones. We now are able to make many claims about the mind, consciousness, the nature of reality through the lens of scientific paradigm; however, many of the oldest problems still exist; people who have strong belief in conflicting perspectives see no reason to adopt a new view; different schools of metaphysics focus on different issues; and many of the oldest and purest questions in metaphysics are able to adapt themselves to avoid being answered.
