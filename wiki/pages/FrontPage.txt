This is the front page of the wiki. Its format is roughly based
on WikiWiki by C2. 

It supports:
* lists, _italics_, __bold__ via MarkDown
* AnonyMous editing
* CamelCase for internal linking
* Link coloring
* Page backups and changelogs
* **New** IP logging added
* **New** recent changes added

Try viewing the pages on AnonyMous or ThisWiki, or make an article of your own, by following a dead link, creating a link to a non-existing page, or by modifying the URL field.
